# Discovering Yeongjongdo: Where Urban Convenience Meets Island Charm 🏝️

The moment I stepped off the airport express train onto Yeongjongdo (영종도), I knew this wasn't just another stopover destination. As Korea's gateway island hosting the Incheon International Airport, Yeongjongdo offers an intriguing blend of modern infrastructure and traditional island life that most travelers rush past – but I'm here to show you why it deserves more than just a passing glance.

## Getting There & Around 🚆

### From Incheon International Airport:
- Airport Railroad (AREX): 3,000 KRW (~$2.30)
- Airport Limousine Bus: 7,000 KRW (~$5.40)
- Taxi: 15,000-20,000 KRW (~$11.50-15.40)

Pro tip: Get a T-money card from any convenience store to save on transportation costs and avoid the hassle of buying single tickets.

## Best Time to Visit 🌤️

I've visited Yeongjongdo in different seasons, and each offers something unique:
- Spring (March-May): Perfect for beach walks and outdoor activities
- Summer (June-August): Beach season, but prepare for crowds
- Fall (September-November): Ideal weather and fewer tourists
- Winter (December-February): Dramatic coastal views, fewer crowds

## Must-Visit Spots 📍

### 1. Eurwangni Beach (을왕리 해수욕장)
This is where I spent my first sunset on the island, and it remains my favorite spot. The 2km stretch of golden sand offers spectacular views of passing aircraft and the West Sea.

Best time for photos: Golden hour (1 hour before sunset)
Entry: Free

### 2. Yeongjong Traditional Market (영종도 전통시장)
The aromas of fresh seafood and sound of vendors calling out their daily specials create an authentic Korean market experience. Don't miss:
- Fresh garibi (가리비, scallops): 10,000 KRW (~$7.70) per serving
- Grilled mackerel: 8,000 KRW (~$6.15)
- Local specialties like seafood pajeon
